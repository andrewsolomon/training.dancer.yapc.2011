FIXMEs from the class
===================





5. 12:24 < rufus> just under the template file config, it says /time instead of 
               /date_time


7. 
12:37 < dakkar> asolomon: re ex8: why comma separated? would multi-valued 
                params be more interesting?
12:37 < asolomon> dakkar: see ex9
12:38 < dakkar> not really, they are 3 different params
12:38 < asolomon> sorry - what's a multivalued param?
12:38 < dakkar>  http://foo/bar?q=1&q=2&q=3
12:39 < asolomon> dakkar: got it - i'll make that ex 10 (or 8.5 or something)
12:38 < dakkar>  http://foo/bar?q=1&q=2&q=3
